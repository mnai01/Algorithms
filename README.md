```
Fine the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.
(Find the 1st and 2nd largest numbers in a list, multiple them and return them)
```

**Hw2**
```
Solve the following two problems:

1)  Develop an algorithm to find the floor of a square root of an integer number. Analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithm.

2)  Develop an algorithm to find the longest decreasing subsequence of a sequence of numbers. The elements of the subsequence need not be adjacent in the sequence. For example, the sequence <1,7, 8, 5, 4,9> has longest decreasing subsequence <7, 5, 4>. Analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithm.
